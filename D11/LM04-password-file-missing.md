Great question—this sometimes happens!
**If**

```bash
docker exec -it gitlab-ee grep 'Password:' /etc/gitlab/initial_root_password
```

**returns nothing (empty output),**
it usually means:

1. The initial root password was already used (file is deleted after first login or password change).
2. The container is very new and password wasn’t generated yet (rare).
3. The container name is different, or you're running `gitlab-ce` but using `gitlab-ee` in the command.

---

## **What to Do Next**

### **A. Try Checking the Container Name**

Run:

```bash
docker ps
```

* Make sure the container name is exactly `gitlab-ee` (or `gitlab-ce`, etc).
* If your container is called `gitlab-ce`, use:

  ```bash
  docker exec -it gitlab-ce grep 'Password:' /etc/gitlab/initial_root_password
  ```

---

### **B. The File is Gone (Most Common Case)**

**If the password file is gone:**

* GitLab expects you to reset the password manually.

#### **How to Reset the Root Password:**

1. **Start an interactive bash shell inside the running GitLab container:**

   ```bash
   docker exec -it <container_name> bash
   ```

   Example:

   ```bash
   docker exec -it gitlab-ee bash
   ```

2. **Run the Rails console:**

   ```bash
   gitlab-rails console -e production
   ```

3. **Reset the root password using:**

   ```ruby
   user = User.where(id: 1).first
   user.password = 'YourNewPassword'
   user.password_confirmation = 'YourNewPassword'
   user.save!
   exit
   ```

   * Replace `'YourNewPassword'` with a strong password.

4. **Exit the container shell:**

   ```bash
   exit
   ```

5. **Login to GitLab web UI**

   * Username: `root`
   * Password: The new password you just set

---

### **C. (Optional) If You Want to Regenerate the Initial Password File**

* This isn’t supported by GitLab; you have to reset as above.
* If you want, you can also **restart the container** (won't bring the password file back).

| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Password file empty/missing | Reset root password with Rails console (see above) |
| Container name mismatch     | Use correct container name with `docker exec`      |
| File never created (rare)   | Wait, or check logs, or reset as above             |
